#   Arranging Coins

'''
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        root = ((1 + 8 * n)**0.5 - 1) / 2
        return math.floor(root)
