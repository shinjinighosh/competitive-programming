#   Unique Paths

'''
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[1] * n for _ in range(m)]
        for i, j in product(range(1, m), range(1, n)):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]
        return dp[-1][-1]
